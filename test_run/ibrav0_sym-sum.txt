Several syms are not detected because sym is incomensurate with fft grid:
	70


sg 73:
	QE detects 4 syms instead of 8.
sg 211:
	QE detects 48 syms instead of 24. It does not recognize the sym since it thinks it is a supercell
sg 204:
	same as 211
sg 36:
	spglib detects 7 as sg 63 which as 8 syms instead of 4.
	QE does the same but for the structure nb 7.
sg 15:
	QE miss 2 syms out of 4 in some cases while other are well detected
sg 64:
	QE supercell so it disable the 4 translational and fractional syms
sg 121:
	QE detect the right syms with 8 additional ones in 1 case
sg 88:
	QE miss the syms or find wrong ones. others are good
sg 74:
	QE supercell so it disable the 4 translational and fractional syms
sg 68:
	QE supercell so it disable the 4 translational and fractional syms
sg 119:
	QE detects good syms and 8 additional ones
sg 197:
	QE detects good syms and 12 additional ones
sg 21:
	QE detects good syms and 4 additional ones
sg 42:
	QE detects wrong syms in 1 instance
sg 72:
	QE supercell so it disable the 4 translational and fractional syms
sg 45:
	QE supercell so it disable the 2 translational and fractional syms and detects 2 additional wrong ones 
sg 142:
	QE supercell detects wrong syms im 1 instance
sg 141:
	QE supercell detects wrong syms im 1 instance
sg 217:
	QE finds 24 inversion symsthat are wrong
sg 82:
	QE finds 4 inversion symsthat are wrong
sg 67:
	QE supercell so it disable the 4 translational and fractional syms
sg 40:
	QE supercell so it disable the 2 translational and fractional syms and adds 2 wrong inversions
sg 37:
	QE supercell so it disable the 2 translational and fractional syms and adds 2 wrong inversions
sg 20:
	QE finds 2 good and miss 2 fractional syms
sg 98:
	QE doesn't find a sym


All the considered sg have a few representatives that seem properly detected (no explicit check done here).
